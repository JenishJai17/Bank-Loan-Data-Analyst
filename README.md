# Bank Loan Data Analyst

## Business Problem: 
To monitor and assess our bank's lending activities and performance, we need to create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help us make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies.


## Steps

1. Data Cleaning: We used many Excel features to clean up the data for analysis.

2. Data Processing: We process the data to combine valuable calculations from the given Datasets.

3. Data Analysis: We created Pivot Charts and tables with the help of which we extracted key insights

## Conclusion

1. The trend suggests that the Number of Applicants for Loan was on a gradual increase throughout the year highlighting that it may follow the same trend in the future.

2. Citizens of "California" state in the USA are more reliant on loans followed by people of "Texas" and "New York".

3. Almost 3/4th of the Loan Applicants preferred a Loan repayment period of 36 months compared to 60 months.

4. The majority reason for applying for a loan is "Debt - Consolidation" followed by "Credit Card" Payments.
